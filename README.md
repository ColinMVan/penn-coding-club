# Penn Coding Club

I created the main file structure in file code.
Run git fetch and it should show you the files and move into the file code
Just run in the terminal: npm install
And it will just install all of the dependancy
and run in the terminal: npm run dev
to start up the server(localhost)
and just open your browser and type localhost:5173
